<h2> Aim </h2>
As a lover of retro games, the main aim of this game was to replicate this and make it so that it can be enjoyed by any age that loves retro gamers, but a simpler version.

<h2> About: </h2>
This is a game with questions and a game of Whac a mole, all done mostly.
The game has 2 levels,it starts off with a series of questions and if the player gets up to '4' points on the first level, they can move up to Level 2.
<ul>
<li> Level 1 was inspired by basic question and answer as discussed with my college professor.</li>
<li> Level 2 was inspired by Kenny Yip Coding, I found his tutorial on youtube which helped serve some of my ideas for the level 2 I had in mind:</li>

<h2> Known issues/Future development: </h2>
<ul>
<li> In level 2, the gem and heart sometimes get stuck and don't move from their pipes, this may have been fixed but is a known issue</li>
<li> The responsiveness on the pages aren't great but this was being worked on and will be used for future development</li>
</ul>
